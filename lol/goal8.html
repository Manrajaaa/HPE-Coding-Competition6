        <h1>Goal 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth</h1> 
        <p>Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Goal 8 promotes sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Roughly half the world's population still lives on the equivalent of about US$2 a day, and in too many places, having a job does not guarantee an escape from poverty. Slow and uneven progress in this area requires us to rethink and retool our economic and social policies aimed at eradicating poverty. A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress. Sustainable economic growth will require societies to create the conditions that allow people to have quality jobs that stimulate the economy while not harming the environment.</p>

        <h1>Goal 17 - Patnership for the Goals</h1> 
        <p>Goal 17 seeks to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalise the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development. A successful sustainable development agenda requires partnerships between governments, the private sector and civil society. These inclusive partnerships, built upon principles and values, a shared vision, and shared goals that place people and the planet at the centre, are needed at the global, regional, national and local levels.</p>
